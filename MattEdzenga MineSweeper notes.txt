Matt Edzenga MineSweeper Notes:

-main requirements:
	-resizable grid of blocks
	-each block needs to easily read the blocks next to it
		-could use a 2d array for this
		-each block would store its x/y position
-block manager class layout:
	-blocks[x][y]
	-GenerateBlockLayout
	-xDim
	-yDim
	-totalMines
-block class layout:
	-Block(isMineIn, numDispIn)
	-isFlagged
	-isMine
	-numDisp
	-isClicked
	-doClick()
	-toggleFlag()
-main click algorithm (from doClick)
	-check if the current block is a mine
		-if so, lose the game
		-if not, check the numDisp of the block
			-if the numdisp is 0, then check the 8 surrounding blocks for if they are 0 as well
				-any blocks that are 0, do a doClick() operation
-block layout algorithm
	-pick a random number from 0 to each dimension max
	-repeat the above action until the totalMines requirement is met
		-check if each new mine is a spot already occupied by a mine
			-if so, generate a new random position
-game win check
	-if all blocks on the board are either marked as "isClicked" or "isBomb", then the player wins
	-can do this after every click action
